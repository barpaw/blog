# Harnessing the Power of Water: Hydroelectric Energy

## Hydroelectric Power: Clean and Renewable

### Sustainable Energy from Water

Hydroelectric power is a cornerstone of renewable energy, utilizing **massive dams**, *river turbines*, and ~~fossil fuels~~.

#### Types of Hydroelectric Facilities

- **Impoundment Facilities** - Utilize a dam to store river water in a reservoir.
- **Run-of-River Facilities**
  - Do not store water
  - Generate power from the flow of the river
